# Espresso Machine
This is a C++ program for an espresso machine that allows the user to place an order, and generates a receipt with the details of the order. The program uses a console-based text user interface (TUI) and a file input/output system for generating and saving the receipt.

## Installation
To use this program, you need to have a C++ compiler installed on your computer. You can download and install one of the following:

- GCC
- Clang
- Microsoft Visual Studio
- Code::Blocks
Then, you can download the source code from this repository and compile it using your compiler.

## Usage
When you run the program, it will prompt you to enter your name and phone number. Then, it will display the menu of coffee flavors and cup sizes. You can use the arrow keys to navigate through the menu and the Enter key to select an item. You can select the size of the cup, and the program will calculate the price of your order.

After you have placed your order, the program will generate a receipt that shows the details of your order, including the name of the coffee flavor, the size of the cup, the price of the item, the subtotal, the discount, the tax, and the total amount. You can choose to either print the receipt to a file or display it on the screen.
